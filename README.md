## Gmail Vacation Emails

### Purpose
This script provides some advanced functionality to Gmail's "Vacation Email AutoReply." Normally the vacation auto-reply is turned on when a person is going to be away from their email and needs to notify anyone who sends them a message.

This script goes beyond that. 

- It allows you to specify a *white-list* of people who do not receive auto-replies
- Automatically archives and tags emails that auto-replies are sent to for easy recovery
- Unarchives emails that become *important*
